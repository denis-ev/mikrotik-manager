## Features

### Dashboard
- Live KPI cards: total devices, online/offline count, connected wireless clients, active alerts, fleet-wide 30-day availability %
- Device type distribution chart
- Firmware update notifications with per-device details
- Historical client count graph (1h → 30d range)
- **Operations view** — a second dashboard mode focused on running the network:
  - **Things to handle** — a server-side insights engine that surfaces actionable issues across the fleet: offline devices, firmware/RouterBOOT updates, CPU/memory pressure, devices missing recent backups, connectivity flapping, and WiFi quality problems (weak-signal clients, co-channel overlap, high TX-retry radios), severity-ordered
  - **Quick actions that actually run** — Run discovery, Back up all online devices, Sync config (pull `/export` + re-collect), and Open terminal (device picker → live in-browser SSH terminal), each with inline progress/result
  - **Capacity & health** — per-device CPU/memory meters sorted by pressure
  - **Security posture rollup** — fleet average hardening score, high-severity finding count, and the lowest-scoring devices, deep-linking to the Security Center
  - **Recent activity feed** — merged config changes, user actions, and alerts
  - **Anomaly insights** (Mist-style) — compares each device's last 30 minutes of client-count and CPU against its **same-hour-of-day 14-day baseline** and flags ≥2.5σ deviations, plus error-log burst detection — surfaced alongside rogue-AP alerts in Things to handle

### Device Management
- Add, edit, and delete MikroTik devices (routers, switches, wireless APs)
- Automatic polling: status, model, firmware version, RouterOS version
- Firmware update availability detection
- Per-device notes, rack location, and physical address with map support
- Device credential encryption at rest
- **Encrypted API (api-ssl)** — devices whose API runs on the SSL port (8729) are reached over TLS automatically; RouterOS's default self-signed certificates are accepted, so the credentials and session are encrypted in transit without any manual certificate trust
- **Bulk device add** — "Try All" discovered devices runs as a server-side background job (survives browser tab close) with live progress and cancel support
- CPU load and historical sparkline displayed correctly for all device types, including hardware switches that report 0% CPU via ASIC offloading
- **Device tags** — colored labels for organizing and filtering devices; full tag management in Settings
- **30-day availability tracking** — per-device uptime %, outage count, and longest outage duration recorded automatically; visible on the device Overview tab and the fleet dashboard

### Routers
- Routing table viewer
- Interface overview with IP assignments
- Router-specific settings and configuration

### Firewall & Security
A Meraki/UniFi-grade firewall experience built on the full RouterOS feature set:
- **Dedicated Security Center** — a top-level section with fleet-wide hardening scores, a per-device posture list, and a "Common Findings" rollup that aggregates identical issues across every device; "Manage" deep-links into a device's Security tab. Firewall/NAT, bandwidth, and connections are available on every managed RouterOS device (routers, switches, and APs)
- **Friendly rule builder** — Allow/Drop/Reject action chips, Any/Address/Address-List source & destination pickers, well-known port presets (HTTPS/HTTP/SSH/DNS/RDP/SMB), connection-state chips, per-rule logging, and a live plain-English preview of every rule
- **Address lists as reusable objects** — define `LAN`, `Trusted`, `Blocklist` etc. once and reference them from any rule (the Meraki/UniFi "groups" concept)
- **Rule reordering** — move rules up/down (order is decisive in RouterOS) with a single click
- **Hit counters & dead-rule insight** — per-rule packet/byte counters surface which rules are matching and flag zero-hit rules; one-click counter reset
- **NAT wizards** — guided Port Forward, Masquerade (internet sharing), and 1:1 NAT flows instead of raw fields, plus a Custom mode
- **Safe-apply lockout guard** — refuses to apply an unscoped `input`-chain drop/reject that would lock the platform/admin out of the device, requiring explicit confirmation
- **Security posture audit** — per-device hardening checklist (insecure services like telnet/ftp/www/api, missing input-chain firewall, SNMP exposure, outdated RouterOS/RouterBOOT firmware) with a score and one-click remediation, plus a management-services table
- **Bandwidth control** — simple-queue management with up/down caps per IP, subnet, or interface, and a one-click "Limit this client" action on the client detail page
- **Active connections viewer** — live connection-tracking table (source/destination, protocol, state, rate, bytes) with search

### Switches
- VLAN management (create, edit, delete VLANs)
- Per-port configuration and VLAN membership
- Switch overview with port status
- **Per-port connected clients** — selecting a port shows the clients actually connected to it (hostname, MAC, IP, VLAN, connection time) with links to each client's page. Crucially, it distinguishes *physically connected* clients from the raw MAC table: **uplink/trunk ports are auto-detected** (via an LLDP/MNDP topology neighbor, MACs spanning multiple VLANs, or a high MAC count) and show an "uplink" explainer instead of every MAC reachable through the port — with a one-click disclosure to view the full MAC table when you need it
- **Copy VLANs from another switch** — 3-step wizard that copies VLAN IDs and names from any other managed switch onto the current device, with manual per-VLAN port assignment (tagged/untagged) using a click-to-cycle interface chip grid, conflict detection with per-VLAN skip/overwrite control, and a review summary before any changes are applied

### Wireless
- Per-AP SSID management — create, edit, enable/disable, delete wireless interfaces
- **Bulk SSID deployment** — push an SSID configuration to all managed APs simultaneously
- Security profile management (WPA2/WPA3, PSK, EAP)
- Hardware radio information and band filtering (RouterOS 7 wifi package + legacy wlan package)
- Scheduled and on-demand **spectral scans** per radio
- Scheduled and on-demand **AP scans** (nearby access point discovery)
- Real-time radio monitoring
- Wireless client tracking with vendor lookup
- **Device fingerprinting** — every client is classified into a device category (server/NAS, computer, phone, TV, camera, printer, game console, voice assistant, smart-home, IoT, network gear…) from its OUI vendor and hostname, shown as an icon on the Clients list. The fingerprint is fully **overridable per client** on the client detail page, and the override persists across re-polls
- **RF Health** (fleet-wide on the Wireless page and per-AP on the Radios tab):
  - **Channel usage map** across 2.4 / 5 / 6 GHz, computed from each radio's operating channel (live-resolved from `monitor` on the wifi package when channels are auto), highlighting in-use channels and **co-channel overlap**
  - **AP deployment density** — connected clients plotted across the −90…−30 dBm signal scale, with a coverage-gap warning when too many clients connect at weak RSSI
  - **AP radio TX retries** histogram (0%→35%+) with a band selector, derived from per-client CCQ (legacy `wireless` driver)
  - **WiFi connectivity success** funnel (Association / Authentication / DHCP) derived from device logs
- **Rogue & neighbor AP detection** — cross-references stored AP-scan results against your own SSIDs and radio MACs. A foreign BSSID broadcasting one of *your* SSIDs is flagged as a **rogue / evil-twin** (and raised in Operations → Things to handle); everything else is a ranked neighbor-network inventory

### Guest WiFi (Hotspot)
A one-click captive-portal guest network on RouterOS Hotspot, under **Wireless → Guest WiFi**:
- **Guided setup wizard** — creates the whole guest network in one pass: a new **guest SSID** (a virtual AP on every physical radio), **VLAN segregation** (guest SSIDs tagged onto the bridge with an L3 VLAN interface for the portal — or a dedicated guest bridge when no VLAN is given), IP pool, DHCP, hotspot profile, portal server, a bandwidth-limited guest user profile, and an optional masquerade NAT rule. Idempotent, with honest warnings (e.g. bridge VLAN-filtering disabled). Can also target an existing interface.
- **Vouchers** — batch-generate access codes (`XXXX-XXXX`, no ambiguous characters) with validity hours, data caps, and a speed profile; **printable voucher sheets** (3-up cards with code, limits, and connection instructions) and a used/unused status table
- **Guests online** — live session table (code, IP, MAC, session time, down/up bytes) with one-click disconnect
- **Walled garden** — sites reachable before login, managed inline; per-server enable/disable

### Network Services
Each service supports multi-device management with conflict detection:

| Service | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| **DHCP** | IPv4 & IPv6 servers, address pools, static leases, live lease table |
| **DNS** | Upstream servers, static records (A/AAAA/CNAME/MX/NS/PTR/TXT/SRV), cache flush, DoH |
| **NTP** | Server (broadcast/manycast), client (unicast/multicast), sync status |
| **WireGuard** | Interface management, peer configuration, public key display, RX/TX stats |
| **Logging** | Syslog actions (remote/memory/disk/echo) and routing rules; single-device or push-to-all with per-entry coverage; enable/disable rules |
| **NetFlow** | One-toggle Traffic Flow (NetFlow v9/IPFIX) export per device, pointed at the built-in collector; live export status per device |
| **Discovery & SNMP** | Fleet-wide LLDP enable/disable and SNMP v1/v2c/v3 configuration with per-device status tables, scoped to all devices, routers only, or switches only |

### Traffic Analytics (NetFlow)
- **Built-in NetFlow/IPFIX collector** — receives Traffic Flow exports from your routers on UDP 2055 (no external tools needed); decoder supports both NetFlow v9 and IPFIX
- **Per-client usage accounting** — flows are attributed to known clients (IP → MAC) so every client shows real upload/download totals; "Data (today)" column on the Clients page and an App Traffic card on each client's detail page
- **Application breakdown** — flows are classified by protocol and port into readable categories (HTTPS, QUIC, DNS, SSH, Email, WireGuard, …) with fleet-wide and per-client views
- **Top talkers** — ranked client bandwidth usage over 1h/24h/7d/30d ranges on the dedicated Traffic page
- **Automatic deduplication** — a flow crossing two managed routers is exported twice; the collector keeps only the best exporter per client each window so totals are never double-counted
- **NAT-tolerant ingest** — when routers export from behind NAT or a VPN/Tailscale subnet router, packets arrive from an address that matches no managed device; the collector accepts these as per-source "unidentified" exporters (configurable) so flows are still attributed to clients instead of silently dropped, and the NetFlow page shows a banner naming the NAT'd source. Per-device export status/flow counters require un-NAT'd sources — exempt `udp/2055` from masquerade on the gateway to restore device identity (and exact cross-device dedup)
- **Fully UI-configurable** — enable the collector, set its address/port/version in the NetFlow page, then toggle export per device; the platform pushes `/ip traffic-flow` configuration to each router via the RouterOS API
- Configurable retention for detailed time-series (default 30 days) and daily rollups (default 365 days)

### Network Topology
- **LLDP-authoritative** — LLDP links are treated as ground truth; CDP/MNDP links to the same neighbor are automatically suppressed, eliminating spurious "Shared Segment" nodes
- Bidirectional LLDP pairs merged into a single canonical edge with both port names labeled
- Auto-discovered network map using LLDP, CDP, and MNDP neighbor data
- Interactive node graph with device type icons and protocol-priority link deduplication
- **Manual link drawing** — Connect Mode lets you drag between any two devices to draw a persistent connection for devices with no auto-discovered neighbors; connections are stored in the database and survive page reloads
- **Orphan node detection** — devices with no known connections are grouped in a dedicated row with an orange warning banner prompting Connect Mode usage
- Manual links render as purple dashed edges with a midpoint delete button

### Device Network Tools
Per-device diagnostic and testing tools accessible from the device detail Tools tab:

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| **Ping** | ICMP reachability test with RTT and loss metrics |
| **Traceroute** | Hop-by-hop path trace to any destination |
| **IP Scan** | ARP sweep of a subnet to discover live hosts |
| **Wake-on-LAN** | Send a magic packet from the MikroTik device to wake a host |
| **Packet Capture** | Start the RouterOS sniffer, capture for 5–60 seconds, download a `.pcap` file directly to your browser (opens in Wireshark). Requires SSH credentials on the device. |
| **Bandwidth Test** | Measure throughput between two devices. Select any managed device as the target — the bandwidth-test server is automatically enabled on the target before the test and disabled afterward. Manual IP mode available for non-managed targets. |

### Firmware Orchestration
Staged fleet-wide RouterOS upgrades, under the top-level **Firmware** section:
- **Fleet versions** — current RouterOS, latest-known version, and pending RouterBOOT upgrades per device; **Check all for updates** queries every online device live
- **Release notes in-app** — when an update is available, a "What's new" link on the device's firmware section (and the version on the Firmware page) opens MikroTik's official changelog for that exact version in a modal, with a link out to mikrotik.com
- **Staged rollouts in waves** — select updatable devices and assign each to a wave (wave 1 = **canary**); the orchestrator runs one rollout at a time, devices sequentially, through a verified pipeline: **pre-upgrade backup → install → ride out the reboot → verify it returned healthy on the new version → next device**
- **Halt on failure** stops the entire remaining rollout if any device fails, so a bad build never reaches the fleet; a reboot that comes back on the *old* version counts as a failure
- **Schedule** rollouts for a future time (pair with a maintenance window); live wave-grouped progress with animated per-device status, `from → to` versions, error detail, and **Cancel** (never interrupts an in-flight flash)

### Backups
- Trigger RouterOS backups on demand via SSH
- **Scheduled automatic backups** — pick a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule and time in Settings (no cron knowledge required); runs for all online devices
- Download and manage backup files from the UI

### Platform & Automation
Make the platform scriptable and integrable, under **Settings → Automation**:
- **Scoped API tokens** — issue `mtm_…` tokens with **read** or **write** scope and optional expiry for scripting and IaC; the token is shown once (only a SHA-256 hash is stored) and maps onto the role model — no token can perform admin actions or manage other tokens. Use with `Authorization: Bearer mtm_…` against the full REST API
- **Outbound webhooks** — subscribe URLs to any of 12 events (device up/down, log errors, high CPU/memory, cert expiry, device discovered, firmware update, config drift, firmware rollout completed/failed); deliveries are JSON POSTs **HMAC-SHA256 signed** (`X-MTM-Signature`) when a secret is set, with last-status tracking and a Send-test button. Fired through the same alert pipeline (respecting alert rules, cooldowns, and maintenance windows)
- **Scheduled email reports** — daily/weekly/monthly HTML fleet summaries (devices online, outages + downtime, error/warning counts, updates pending, backups taken, top clients by traffic) to any recipient list, using your Alerting SMTP settings; Send-now for instant delivery

### Configuration History
- Per-device config snapshots based on the device's full RouterOS `/export` — config-only, so counters and operational state never create noise — captured automatically whenever the configuration changes (deduplicated by content hash, so a snapshot is only stored on a real change)
- **Config History** tab on each device with a timeline of snapshots and a one-line summary of what changed (e.g. `+8 / −3 lines`)
- Side-by-side **line diff** between any two snapshots, rendered as readable RouterOS commands
- **Capture snapshot** button for an on-demand checkpoint, with honest feedback when nothing has changed since the last one
- **One-click rollback** — each snapshot links a restorable `.rsc` backup, so rolling back reuses the proven restore path
- The snapshot and its backup are one artifact: snapshot backups are clearly badged **Config Snapshot** on the Backups page, and deleting one (from either place) removes the other so they never drift apart
- Fires a `config_drift` alert (off by default) when a device's configuration changes
- Snapshot cadence and retention configurable via `config_snapshot_interval_min` / `config_snapshot_retention`

### Alerts
Configurable alert rules with cooldown periods:
- Device online / offline
- High CPU or memory usage (configurable threshold)
- SSL certificate expiry warning
- Firmware update available
- RouterOS log errors and warnings
- New device discovered
- Configuration changed (drift detection)

Alert delivery channels: **Email**, **Slack**, **Discord**, **Telegram**

### Maintenance Windows
- Schedule planned downtime windows per device or group of devices to suppress alerts automatically
- One-time or recurring windows (cron-based)
- Active window management with activate/deactivate controls
- Managed from Settings → Maintenance

### Audit Log
- Every write operation (create, update, delete, push) performed by an authenticated user is recorded automatically
- Log includes: user, timestamp, HTTP method, API path, entity type/ID, summary, IP address, and HTTP response status
- Filterable and paginated view in Settings → Audit Log
- Useful for multi-operator environments to track who changed what and when

### Configuration Templates
- Define reusable configuration sets (DNS servers, NTP servers, syslog host) and push them to one or more managed devices in a single operation
- Per-device result reporting (success / error per device)
- Managed from Settings → Config Templates

### Global Search
Instant search across devices, clients, and events from the top navigation bar.

### User Management & Access Control
- Role-based access: **Admin**, **Operator** (read/write), **Viewer** (read-only)
- Admin-only user creation and role assignment
- JWT authentication with secure session handling
- **Two-factor authentication (TOTP)** — per-user 2FA setup via QR code (compatible with Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.); login requires a 6-digit code after password when enabled; disable with password confirmation
- **Credential preset access control** — presets can be restricted to admins only (`allow_operator_use`); operators only see presets they are permitted to use when adding or updating devices

### TLS / HTTPS
- Automatic self-signed certificate generation on first run
- Upload a custom certificate and private key via the Settings UI
- nginx handles TLS termination and HTTP→HTTPS redirect

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2+)
- MikroTik devices running **RouterOS 6.x or 7.x** with the API service enabled
- Network access from the host running this application to your MikroTik devices on port **8728** (or your configured API port)

---

## Quick Deploy (Pre-built Images)

No source code or build toolchain required — just Docker and Docker Compose.

### 1. Download the compose file

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2GT-Media-Group-LLC/mikrotik-manager/main/docker-compose.ghcr.yml
```

### 2. Create your environment file

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2GT-Media-Group-LLC/mikrotik-manager/main/.env.example
mv .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set at minimum:

```env
JWT_SECRET=your_long_random_jwt_secret_here
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_character_encryption_key_
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-domain.example.com
```

### 3. Start the application

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml up -d
```

Docker pulls the pre-built images from GitHub Container Registry and starts the stack. No compilation, no cloning.

### 4. Open the app

Navigate to **https://localhost** (or your server's IP/hostname) and log in with `admin` / `admin`.

> To update to the latest release: `docker compose -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml pull && docker compose -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml up -d`

---

## Quick Start (Build from Source)

For contributors or anyone who wants to build the images locally.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2GT-Media-Group-LLC/mikrotik-manager.git
cd mikrotik-manager
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Copy the example environment file and edit it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

At minimum, change these values in `.env`:

```env
# Required — use long, random strings
JWT_SECRET=your_long_random_jwt_secret_here
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_character_encryption_key_

# Required for production deployments (set to your domain)
# CORS_ORIGIN=https://manager.example.com

# Optional — defaults work for a local install
DB_PASSWORD=mikrotik_secure_pw
INFLUXDB_TOKEN=mytoken123456789
```

> **Security note:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. The `.gitignore` already excludes it.

### 3. Start the application

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The first run will:
- Build the frontend (React → static files)
- Build the backend (TypeScript → Node.js)
- Initialize PostgreSQL with the database schema
- Initialize InfluxDB
- Generate a self-signed TLS certificate

### 4. Open the app

Navigate to **https://localhost** (or your server's IP/hostname).

Accept the browser's self-signed certificate warning, or upload a real certificate in **Settings → TLS Certificate**.

### 5. Log in

Default credentials on first run:

| Username | Password | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `admin` | `admin` | Admin |

**Change the default password immediately** in Settings → Users.

---

## Enabling the RouterOS API

Typically, API access is enabled on MikroTik devices. However if you can't connect via API, ensure the API service is enabled:

```
/ip service enable api
```

For API over SSL (port 8729):
```
/ip service enable api-ssl
```

The default API port is `8728`. You can configure a different port per device in the MikroTik Manager interface.

---

## Configuration Reference

All configuration is done via environment variables in `.env`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `JWT_SECRET` | *(auto-generated & persisted if unset)* | Secret for signing JWT tokens. Leave unset to have a strong one generated on first boot; set it to pin your own value. |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | *(auto-generated & persisted if unset)* | Key for encrypting device passwords at rest. Leave unset to auto-generate; set it to pin your own value. |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | *(localhost defaults set by Docker Compose)* | Comma-separated list of browser origins allowed to call the API (e.g. `https://manager.example.com`). **Required in production** — set this to your domain. |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | `mikrotik_secure_pw` | PostgreSQL password |
| `INFLUXDB_TOKEN` | `mytoken123456789` | InfluxDB admin token |
| `INFLUXDB_ORG` | `mikrotik-manager` | InfluxDB organization name |
| `INFLUXDB_BUCKET` | `metrics` | InfluxDB bucket for time-series data |
| `INFLUXDB_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `admin_password_123` | InfluxDB admin UI password |
| `HTTP_PORT` | `80` | Host port for HTTP (redirects to HTTPS) |
| `HTTPS_PORT` | `443` | Host port for HTTPS |

### Secret management (self-healing)

`JWT_SECRET` (session signing) and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (AES-256-GCM credential encryption, `backend/src/utils/crypto.ts`) are managed automatically:

- **If set to a strong value in the environment**, that value is used — you stay in control.
- **If unset or left at an old default**, the backend generates a strong secret **once**, persists it to the `app_data` volume (`SECRETS_DIR`, default `/app/data`), and reuses it on every boot. Secrets live outside the database so a DB dump alone can't reveal the key protecting the credentials in it.

Upgrades are non-breaking: on startup, existing ciphertext is decrypted via a **legacy-key fallback** (including previous defaults) and transparently **re-encrypted under the current key** by a background sweep. When rotating the JWT secret off a public default, sessions signed with that default are no longer accepted — users simply log in again once.

**Key rotation:** set a new `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (or delete the persisted secret to force regeneration) and restart. Old rows keep decrypting via the legacy fallback and are re-encrypted forward automatically. **If the persisted secret and any prior key are both lost**, ciphertext under that key cannot be recovered — re-enter device credentials or restore a backup.

## Updating

Pull the latest changes and rebuild:

```bash
git pull
docker compose up -d --build backend nginx
```

Database migrations run automatically on backend startup.

## AI Assistance

This project was designed and built with the help of [Claude](https://claude.ai) by Anthropic. AI assistance was used throughout development — including architecture decisions, backend services, frontend components, the CI/CD pipeline, security configuration, and unit tests.

We believe in being transparent about how software is made. The code has also been reviewed and tested using AI and is maintained by the project authors.
